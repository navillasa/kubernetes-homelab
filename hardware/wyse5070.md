# Dell Wyse 5070 — Notes & Upgrades

Purchased $45 used (Grade A/B) off eBay. Included Wi-Fi card, 65W Dell PSU, 8 GB RAM, 64 GB SSD, no OS.

## CPU / Model
- Intel Pentium Silver J5005 (4c/4t, base 1.5 GHz, turbo up to 2.8 GHz, ~10W TDP)
- Great perf/watt for a homelab node, not as fast per-core as i3/i5, but fine for k8s + light services.

## RAM
- Upgraded 2×8 GB (16 GB), DDR4-2400/2666, non-ECC, 1.2V
- Tip: 

## Storage
- M.2 SATA (2280) only (not NVMe)
- Installed: 512 GB TeamGroup MS30
- I left the original 64 GB unused

## Opening the Case / Assembly
1. Power off, unplug everything.
2. Remove back screw, slide top cover and lift.
3. Install RAM – release the side clips gently, modules pop up at an angle. Insert new sticks at same angle, press until clips click. This was the most stressful part lol.
4. Install M.2 SATA SSD – remove screw and old SSD. Insert at angle, screw down gently.
4. Reassemble, connect HDMI for install, keyboard, Ethernet, and power for first boot.

## BIOS / Boot Tips
- Boot menu: **F12**
- BIOS setup: **F2**
- Use **UEFI**, enable USB boot.
- First boot installer messages like *“GPT PMBR size mismatch”* are normal and fixed by the installer.

## UPS
- A small 600–900 VA unit gives plenty of runtime for safe shutdowns.
